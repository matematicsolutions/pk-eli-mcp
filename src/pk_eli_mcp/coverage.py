"""Element 9 of the MateMatic MCP canon: this connector declares its own coverage.

Knowledge about what a corpus does NOT hold is useless while it lives only as prose
in the server instructions - the model has to remember it and choose to relay it, and
an agent has no way to ask. Here it is callable.

Every gap below is grounded in this connector's own source and tool surface. The list
is deliberately never empty: no legal corpus is complete, so an empty gap list would
mean "nobody checked", not "there are no gaps".
